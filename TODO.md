# Milestones

## `v0.4.x`

- [ ] Much more robust test-suite with higher coverage.
- [ ] Optimization for lower-end systems by reducing explicit memory allocations if possible and adopting string views.
- [ ] Support for string natural order (111 > 22).

## `v1.0.0`

- [ ] Some good testing coverage is highly desirable.
- [ ] Add a proper xml schema for this language (rng in place of xsd as they are more flexible for unordered files that I want to support)
