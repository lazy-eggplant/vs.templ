## v0.3.9

Just a quick corrective version over v0.3.7 to fix the behaviour of several untested features, like the newly added filters of `for` loops.  
This release also introduces few more meta-expression operators to allow escaping, and a realistic example emitting HTML to complement the rest of the docs.

### Breaking changes

`sort-by` and `order-by` will now use `|` in place `,` to split multiple options.
