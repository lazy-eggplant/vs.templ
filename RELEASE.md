## v0.3.15

All done! The last `for` and `for-props` prop based commands have been completed.  
With this development of functionality for `vs.templ` is done.

There are minor features planned for the `v0.4.x` branch, but most will be documentation, better examples, formal XML schemas and testing infrastructure.  
Once that is done we are going straight to `v.1` if there are no architectural problems being discovered in the meanwhile.
