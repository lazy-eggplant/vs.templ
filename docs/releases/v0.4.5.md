This release has no visible changes in its functionality (aside for some subtle bug fixes).  
Which is good, it means the language itself is getting stable.  
The main objectives for this release were:

- Reducing complexity and verbosity for most of the code
- Removing obsolete or unused features from earlier revisions
- Better documentation of its public interface.
- Improved tests (so that I can validate the implementation so far)

So, a boring one! But it means that a "final" v1 is getting close.  
Basically all that is left are better tests to see if all commands are working as expected, better documentation and some code optimization.

## Fixes

- Fixed behaviour of filters in cycles. Now they always used meta-expressions only (no prefix `:` in that case).
- Fixed behaviour of `for-range` with negative increments to match specs.
- Fixed behaviour of `~!txt` to return the concatenation of all _cdata_ and _pcdata_ children, not just the first one.

## Breaking changes

The interface to build the preprocessor is now a configuration object.  
This is done to avoid verbosity, and to allow for the definition of more fields if so needed.  
In most cases, using the new interface is just as simple as placing braces between the original args.

## Internal changes

- Code cleanup.
- Speed up `O(nm)` children detection in cycles avoiding multiple passes.
- Rework the mechanisms used in `order-by`
