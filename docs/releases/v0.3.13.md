## v0.3.13

A new intermediate release before moving to `v0.4.x`.  
Surprisingly, whatever was originally scheduled for `v0.3.13` has been delayed again, and other features took the spot!  
So, yeah, the attribute version of `for-props` and `for` are yet to come (at least they are covered in the examples).

The revised plan is for the two missing commands to be in `v0.3.15`, and then we move straight to the new minor.  
At that point the development here will slow down as all core features made their way in the codebase.  
I will be resuming work on `vs.fltk`.

### New features

- `data` command has been added to introduce external data sources in the template.
- `random` order support in `order-by` for `for` loops. Stable random ordering depending on a seed number.
- Examples! LOTS OF EXAMPLEEES! And improved tests.
- We now have the [most blazingly fast web server](https://github.com/lazy-eggplant/vs.http) based on `vs.templ` (according to source myself)!

### Bug fixes

- `test/case` fixed to match the intended specs.
- Fixed behaviour of `for-prop` tag command to ensure good symbols are provided in the loop scope.
- Fixed handling of floating point numbers in expressions.

### Breaking changes

- Reverted and fixed `src` in for cycles to `in` as it initially was.
- Changed the preprocessor interface to introduce the new `loadfn` (the name has been recycled from before, the older `loadfn` is now `includefn`)
