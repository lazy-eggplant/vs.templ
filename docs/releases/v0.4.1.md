This first revision of the new minor has no real incompatibility with the previous one, just some fixes and small new features.

## New features

As expected, this update and the next few ones will be light on new features, mostly focusing on documentation, fixes and architectural improvements.  
Still, using the library for its intended purpose exposed some sharp edges, which will be/have been taken care of.  
This is what is new in this release:

- Centralize `symbol` comparisons have been extended and centralized in a single function serving the entire code base.
- Strings will now support ordering based on the dot modifier even when `random` is used.
- There is default support for string comparisons in the boolean operators of the RPN. Several fixes have been resolved for the other comparisons as well.
- A new prop command `s:enable.*`. It conditionally adds a prop if the condition is true.  
  This might be reworked in `s:when.*` as this override does not conflict with the other `s:when`, but no decision has been taken yet.

## Fixes

- Several conversions are now locale-independent.
- In the UI for the demo, the generate button is now locked while fetching examples.
- Many fixes in the docs and demo examples.
