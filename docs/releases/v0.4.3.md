## v0.4.3

Very minor release, just so that downstream code can take advantage of several fixes and new features.  
Also, this release restores the WASM/WASI build which broke due to `from_chars` compatibility across toolchains.

### New features

- Natural ordering for strings is now supported in `order-by` by all commands (as the new default)
- `order-by` directives can be typed, like `asc:float` or `asc:f` will parse entries as float and sort them accordingly.

### Breaking

- `s:enable.*` has been reworked as an overload of `s:when`. Use it as `s:when.*`.
- Default string comparisons are now following natural ordering, which might break things.
