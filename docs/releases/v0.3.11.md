There has been much more progress than anticipated, and most features needed to reach `v0.4.1` have been filled in already.  
This release is to make sure `vs` can properly use the newly supported syntax in its code and examples.  
Subsequent milestones have been rescheduled, and next new branch `v0.4.x` will be mostly for consolidation, documentation and to incrementally improve the quality of code.  
As such, I am splitting this release here, leaving the two leftover commands for `v0.3.13`.

### New features

- [x] Introduced `include` to load more template files. Please, notice that checks to avoid circular dependencies are to be performed externally.
- [ ] All the remaining prop-based commands.
  - [x] `value`
  - [x] `prop`
  - [ ] `for`
  - [ ] `for-prop`
- [x] Loading the environment of a preprocessor is now possible via `load_env`.
- [x] Improved handling of some expressions making them less verbose.
- [x] Better (and colourful) logging!

### Bug fixing

- Fixed several broken maths operations like `*`.

### Breaking changes

The interface of `preprocessor` was changed once again to support the XML loader function.  
Minimal changes are expected downstream, based on your prior usage.
