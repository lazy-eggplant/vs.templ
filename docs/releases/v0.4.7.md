Introduced tree-rewrite capabilities with `s:for` via the additional attributes `src-children` and `dst-children`.  
Basically the same for cycle is applied recursively inside the relative path described by `src-children` and applied inside `dst-children`.  
The actual behaviour of `dst-children` has not been fully implemented yet, as it requires access to children in reverse order, making it incompatible with the rest of the codebase.  
As such, some custom implementation is needed. For now one can only specify the direct name of the tag embedding children, without nesting as it should be in its final form.  
The nested behaviour of `s:for` is going to change a bit in `v0.4.9` once `dst-children` is fully fixed.

We also added support for more VM functions:
- `timestamp` as the name implies
- `rid` to generate a 256bit random ID serialized as hex string.
- `sid` to generate an `int`-sized sequential ID, autoincrementing and with an optional family ID to have independent sequences.

Finally, logs have now a proper context which provides paths and offsets to the template, data and destination locations which triggered the message.  
For more details, check changes to `log_t::ctx`.
