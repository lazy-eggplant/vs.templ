`vs-templ` is a simple preprocessor for XML files.  
It can be used to statically generate new files from a template definition and a data source.  
Static templates can be seen as extremely simple programs serialized in XML which are interpreted by this preprocessor.  
They consume input data (also XML) to generated output XML.
